    <strong>Employee Engagement</strong>
    <p>We know that our team members are our best asset. With very low turnover of our full time employees, we bring you the reliability of consistent and dependable service year-after-year.</p>

    <p>We do this by encouraging team members to give L.I.V.E. awards to colleagues who are doing an excellent job. We continually pride ourselves by offering employees a safe culture of communication with management to talk one-on-one about all aspects of the job. We reward our team members on a regular basis through employee picnics and special days at the office to encourage a sense comradery and community.</p>
