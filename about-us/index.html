      September 3, 2014: I have lived in Livermore, CA for over 30 years. I have seen a lot of different companies working in our town. You should know that Terracare Associates-TCA is by far the most impressive I have witnessed in many years. Your crew members are clean, quick, efficient and safety conscious. They and their manager(s) should be commended. Thanks for the good work.
