    <h3 class="lede">One of the largest public-private partnerships of its kind in the U.S. Terracare Associates operates as the city public works department for the city of Centennial in Colorado.</h3>

    <p>After successfully completing a five year contract, the Centennial’s city council voted to extend its contract and TCA will continue to provide public works services for five more year for its 103,000 residents.  The partnership with CH2M Hill   and the city of Centennial has garnered numerous awards, including the 2010 National Council for Public-Private Partnerships Service Award; 2009 American Public Works Association-Colorado Chapter Innovative Customer Service Call Center Award; 2010 APWA Innovative Customer Service Call Center Award; and 2011 APWA-Colorado Maintenance-Operation for Energy Award.</p>

We offer a high degree of professionalism that assists our public works clients in the timely completion of critical infrastructure projects.</p>

    <p>We understand having an experienced staff able to develop a flexible and efficient plan to manage and implement all outdoor maintenance of your public works and communicate needs is key to long term partnership.
