    <h3 class="lede">One of the largest public-private partnerships of its kind in the U.S., Terracare Associates-TCA operates as the city public works department for the city of Centennial in Colorado (serving 103,000 residents).</h3>

    <p> After successfully completing a five year contract, the Centennial’s city council voted to extend its contract and Terracare Associates-TCA will continue to provide public works services for five more years.</p>

    <p>Our partnership with the City of Centennial and private industry leader CH2M Hill makes this project so successful that it has garnered numerous awards including: National Council for Public-Private Partnerships Service Award, American Public Works Association-Colorado Chapter Innovative Customer Service Call Center Award, APWA Innovative Customer Service Call Center Award, and  APWA-Colorado Maintenance-Operation for Energy Award.</p>

    <p>Expertise in the public-private partnership landscape gives us a full understanding of the inherent difficulties of public expectation. We are proactive in developing  communication plan that works for each government agency as well as a wide range of stakeholders. We offer a high degree of professionalism and this allows us to continually deliver the timely completion of critical infrastructure projects and meet the highest standards of our public works clients.</p>
