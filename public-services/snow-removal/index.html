<h3>Pre-Storm</h3>

<p>Pre-Storm activities typically include an assessment of equipment and materials to make sure all are in proper working order and available. Storm report watching from multiple sites and communication with authorized representatives help make determinations on when materials should be put down and when plowing should commence. Communication with drivers on all aspects of their shift, equipment deployment and material usage insure smooth and timely clearing of roadways that keeps urban areas functioning and patrons safe as the storm approaches.</p>

<h3>Storm</h3>

<p>Depending on the storms intensity and the size and layout of the entity as well as the service expected Terracare Associates will recommend the number of personnel and equipment to be deployed and the shift that will begin removal. Typically two (2) twelve hour shifts are recommended to provide 24 hours of continuous snow removal and ice control service. Depending on the amount of snow, Terracare Associates makes recommendations on the number of vehicles needed to maintain clear and passable roadways and if any of those vehicles should be depositing melting materials. Vehicles owned by Terracare Associates are equipped with GPS systems so they can be individually tracked by a supervisor and remain in constant contact with managing personnel. This insures that any route change or emergency situation needing to be addressed is handled in a timely and highly efficient manner.</p>

<h3>Clean Up</h3>

<p>The aftermath of any storm requires just as much attention as the storm itself. Continued cleanup of roadways and monitoring for icy conditions is essential to the safety of residents and commuters. Terracare Associates can recommend a schedule that includes ice patrols and other cleanup duties such as further removal of snow and ice from turn lanes, mailbox clusters and storm drains, widening of traffic paths, and adjustment of snow piles from shade to sun so that your entity remains safe and in top working condition.</p>

<h3>Post Storm &amp; Reporting</h3>

<p>Post-storm reporting is an important piece of the storm management process. Terracare Associates works with many entities to determine what information is important to them and how that information can be captured and disseminated. Decisions regarding report schedules and necessary software are determined and recommendations on reports which include details regarding hours, mileage and material usage are made. Data can be collected for sweeping reports and evaluations of equipment and material usage as well.</p>
