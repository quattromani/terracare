On September 23, 2013 the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) was detected in Boulder County, confirming the state of Colorado is infected.   Based on the proven destruction in the Midwest, scientists expect emerald ash borer will ultimately kill almost every unprotected ash tree presently growing in North America.  The emerald ash borer destruction will have a similar (or greater) impact and look on our urban forests as the Mountain Pine Beetle kill in Colorado high country without prevention, as experts in Colorado estimate 15-20% of all trees in the Front Range are ash trees.

#####What is the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB)?
The Emerald Ash Borer is a green beetle native to Asia and Eastern Russia and arrived in the US through a warehouse in southeast Michigan in 2002.  Emerald ash borer damages trees by tunneling (borer) areas under the bark, producing tunnels that obstruct the water and nutrients from moving within the tree. The damage is progressive and difficult to see until permanent damage is already underway. The EAB is considered the most destructive forest pest ever to hit North America and has killed more than 50 million trees across 22 states.
