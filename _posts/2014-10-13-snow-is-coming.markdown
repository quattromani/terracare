Have you ever noticed, when talking about forecasting the weather, people always seem to refer to the Farmer's Almanac. During George Washington's first term as president in 1792, the first editor, Robert B. Thomas introduced the premiere issue of _The Old Farmer's Almanac_ and it is still used readily today. The most important information in the almanac is weather predictions so we can plan ahead.

We at Terracare Associates-TCA use a variety of resources to be prepared and plan ahead for the winter snow and ice season. The 2014-15 winter forecast is predicted to be wetter and colder than normal temperatures and starting early.

To ensure our readiness for inclement weather, TCA has hired over 200 commercial licensed drivers to man the plows, shovel walks and ensure a safe and reliable winter service for our clients. Every driver will attend a mandatory annual orientation and training program the first weeks of October. Ironically, the average first day of snow in the mountain regions is October 15th! The orientation and training goals are to build important winter skills and reiterate best practices in plowing techniques, loader operation, material distribution, proper documentation and above all safety.  We are always conscious of the balance between safe roads, streets and parking lots while having the least amount of impact on the environment. We are committed to providing the best experience to our clients and offer all the latest storm management technology to ensure maximum efficiency, safety, and reliability. We seek a proactive approach to storm management and snow removal and pride ourselves in the management of each weather-related-event and take all safety needs very seriously.

Last week, several of the management team at TCA received from American Public Works Association the completion of -Winter Maintenance Supervisor workshop. Our staff has decades of experience and a breadth of knowledge and resources to accommodate even the toughest of storms â€“ keeping the public safe and healthy.
