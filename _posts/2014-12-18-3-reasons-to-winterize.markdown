After the leaves fall and the weather gets colder, landscape maintenance may appear to be over for the season.  Your deciduous trees and plantings become dormant for the winter so it is easy to assume landscape care is complete for the year.  However, failing to winterize your property may result in a costly plant replacement project in the spring.  Replacing trees and other plantings that were hit by harsh, dry, cold and windy weather can be prevented or greatly minimized through a Winter Landscape Plan.  Here are three reasons why it’s important to winterize your landscape.


<ol class="vertical">
	<li><strong>Lack of Water</strong><br>
	
Trees and shrubs are particularly stressed in October and November after the irrigation systems are shut down for the season. Trees need 10 gallons of water per diameter inch of trunk per month. Shrubs need 3-5 gallons of water per month depending on size, age and type. With Colorado’s windy, dry climate and low moisture it is very important to winter water trees and shrubs in addition to deep root feeding.  Although in the Rocky Mountain region, snow in some years is plentiful, it takes 10-20 inches of snow to equal one inch of water.

During the summer months, trees and shrubs get accustom to watering a couple of times per week and then are suddenly cut off when the water source is stopped. As a guideline, Colorado State University recommends monthly winter watering October thru March especially for newly planted trees trying to get established. The bigger the tree the longer it takes the tree to become established. For example, a one inch diameter tree takes one year to become established and two inch diameter tree needs two years, with proper maintenance, to be considered an established tree. 

Mortality rate of newly planted trees is 1 in 5 in the first two years of planting. More than half, 56% of this destruction is due to lack of water and nutrients in the winter creating undue stress on plant life. This percentage can be greatly reduced with proper maintenance such as winter watering and deep root feeding. A Winter Landscape Plan for water replacement, at a minimum, is highly recommended.

<li><strong>Sun Exposure</strong><br>
The Rocky Mountain states enjoy over 300 days of sunshine each year. That means it is sunny much of the winter. Trees and shrubs on the south and west side of buildings are extremely vulnerable with cold and sun exposure. With reflective sunlight such as light reflecting off of large windows can burn turf, trees and plants. Plantings near parking lots and streetscapes will be the first to dry out and feel the stress of the cold, dry and sun exposed winter months. Especially susceptible to these conditions are evergreens; they continue to transpire and actually need more moisture in winter months than the deciduous trees. Much of the brown needles on spruce and other evergreens this past summer are due to strong sunlight and lack of water during the 2014 winter.

<li><strong>Change of Season</strong><br>

Especially in multi season regions, plant health year round is essential. Protection in summer months from the intense heat can also help in winter. For example mulch is not just for esthetics, it is valuable in protecting trees during the winter as much as in summer months. Mulch preserves moisture better than rock or turf and in a recent study mulch retains moisture up to 400% better than other ground coverings. It can also help tree establishment by improving absorption, prevent soil compaction, keeping the soil cool in summer, protected in winter and improving aeration.

Experts believe without winter watering, proper protection and nourishment approximately 30 % of the trees, shrubs and other plant life can be damaged or destroyed during harsh dry winter months. Developing and scheduling a Winter Landscape Plan can greatly increase the survival rate of all plant life especially new trees and shrubs. The upfront costs and proactive approach to winterizing landscape can keep money in your pocket for landscape enhancements in the spring that your tenants will love. A little TLC for your plants in winter - pays off!
