Pests and unwanted vegetation can impact man-made lakes, ponds and water features. Here are a few things you should know about residential and commercial lakes, ponds and other general water systems. A lot of residential lakes were developed to manage storm water runoff from the entire development and support the delicate ecosystem in place within the lakes.

The water that runs off of residential and commercial properties, parking lots, driveways, streets, etc., will enter the lake system through storm drains. This runoff contains numerous components (oil, grease, chemicals, pesticides, organic matter, etc.) that can affect the biological communities in the lake.

Higher nutrient concentrations can cause significant water quality problems, including greater aquatic vegetation and algae growth a.k.a. "the pests". The increase in nutrients comes mainly from lawn and garden fertilizers, which work their way into the lake. This happens when too much fertilizer is put on lawns, and then the irrigation water runoff carries the extra fertilizer to the lake.

To help control the excessive growth of vegetation and algae in some lakes, the lakes have to be treated during the spring and summer months. Lake residents and property managers can greatly help to keep their community lakes as healthy and attractive as possible, and reduce the need for treating/spraying, by using minimal amounts of fertilizer on their property and preventing irrigation water runoff. Additionally, the disposal of leaves and other organic debris into the storm drains, the lake and/or other waterways should be avoided. Decomposing organic debris can cause oxygen depletion, and stimulate algae growth. The water quality problems this creates increases the probability of fish kills.

**To keep healthy water, residents and property owners are urged to:**

- Never dump lawn clippings or organic material into the lake or storm drains
- Apply fertilizers sparingly, and never exceed label rates
- Adjust sprinklers and/or timers to prevent runoff from lawns or planted areas
- Clean up pet waste immediately and do not wash waste into storm drains
- Do not feed waterfowl, to deter them from taking up residence
- With this in mind, we can all help to maintain community lakes and ponds to protect the delicate ecosystem that is in place.
