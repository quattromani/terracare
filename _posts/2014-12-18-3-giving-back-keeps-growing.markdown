Responsibility is an important word. We believe it is our responsibility to give back to the communities where we live and work. There is no better way for a business to be part of the community. Sharing expertise to help a local nonprofit along with collaborating with other businesses and community partners can be the bond that brings it all together. It’s a win for everyone.

We take the lead in many community volunteer projects year-round and encourage others to do so as well.  Terracare Associates’s – TCA community goal is aligned with green education, outdoor beatification projects and a variety of events and sponsorships that directly support local companies, municipalities and counties that we service. Our volunteer projects have benefitted many communities across four states.  To make the most impactful commitment, our company has selected signature community volunteerism projects that build a partnership with a local nonprofit or school. The fabric of every service project has an integral relationship with schools and nonprofits to benefit the greater good of the community. Two signature projects are the Columbine Memorial located in Colorado and designing and building “Learning Gardens” at local schools in the East Bay area of California.

<strong>Columbine Memorial – Littleton, Colorado</strong>
Several years ago, our president’s daughter was playing softball at Clement Park, adjacent to the <strong>Columbine Memorial</strong>, and she came up with the idea that her dad’s company should get involved with this important community pillar of remembrance. Our president and the dedication of TCA has been helping the foundation ever since.  “I was in high school when the tragedy happened, and giving back makes me proud to be part of this company,”  says Aimee Lacouture, account manager for the memorial site.  

The outdoor memorial was beautifully built in 2007 to commemorate the tragic shooting at Columbine High school. The foundation did not have continuous funding to maintain the perennials, trees, pavers, mulch, mowing and water feature. Now with a year round upkeep, both the employees at Terracare Associates, and the community as a whole, benefit from the ongoing landscape maintenance. Each year in April, just before the anniversary of the tragedy, the company’s field staff ensures the memorial is a beautiful peaceful place for remembrance.  It is a clear example of community stewardship with an impact and we plan to continue to support this partnership for many years to come.

<strong>Learning Gardens – East Bay Schools</strong>
Community gardens are abundant around the country, offering a place for citizens to work together and grow food. <strong>“Learning Gardens”</strong> are trending in popularity to focus more on garden-based learning.  The goal of a <strong>Learning Garden</strong> is to connect children and adults to nutritious foods through hands on experiences with accessible, local, edible gardens.  In 2012, Bill Horn, Senior Vice President, and the California team at TCA made a commitment to connect youth to the Earth, selecting this initiative as one of our signature community projects.  The California team has organized, built and maintained <strong>Learning Gardens</strong> at five bay area schools and growing.  For instance, Horn and his team coordinated with the faculty and students at O’Hara Park Middle School in Oakley, California, to create a <strong>learning garden</strong> for students with disabilities and teachers to use throughout the year.  The proposed garden and composed plant “palette” combined edible and native plants, plus a smattering of native perennials. One of the schools requirements was to have the garden wheelchair accessible, so large smooth paths were installed, plus a shaded patio space.  “This is great!” Colleen Creswell, principal at O’Hara said. “It is far beyond any expectations we could have accomplished.”

A <strong>Learning Garden</strong> became the perfect community investment project.  Engaging efforts to return people to the pre-WWII values of gardening and growing the family’s produce are a wonderful way to help both youth and adults to enjoy and appreciate our Earth and the outdoors again. Under the belief of restoring gardens to how rural American lived to sustain the Earth during this historical time, the created garden sits on or near the school yard, just as it would 100 years ago. TCA applies 21st century technology to this 19th century cultural standard. Installation of drip systems are managed by smart controllers that deliver the amount of water that plants seasonally require. In addition, compost clippings and other plant materials, are removed from a job site and returned both as soil amendment and organic fertilizer.  Ongoing maintenance and harvesting is a partnership between Terracare Associates, students and teachers. Helping gardens create healthy and sustainable food takes responsible commitment, team work, expertise and collaboration.  
In a recent survey poll, 90% of Terracare Associates' employees say that it is of the upmost importance to have a commitment to community service at our company. This commitment to service is extended throughout the organization. This dedication to our communities where we live and work will make the world a better place to live for all.
