			One of your drivers this morning, using his own judgment made the extra effort to NOT leave large snow chunks in front of my drive! This is greatly appreciated for I am not always home and difficult for my wife with our three young children can't shovel. I just wanted to share my story and say Thank you! No good job should go in noticed.
