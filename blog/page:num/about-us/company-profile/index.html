Terracare Associates is a leading commercial landscape maintenance and public infrastructure management company in the Western United States. Each day, Terracare Associates’ almost 400 employees strive to exceedindustry standards and build long term partnerships with our clients to achieve absolute customer confidence. During all seasons, certified and experienced staff manage, maintain and improve landscapes, parks, roadways and infrastructures for a beautiful, healthy, safe and sustainable outdoor environment.</h3> <hr> <h3>Background</h3> <p>Terracare Associates was born out of a vision that Todd Williams had to start a landscape maintenance division while working as a construction manager for Randall, Blake, Inc. He began with one simple idea; to provide long-term high quality landscape maintenance services to clients that RBI had built projects for in the past. As a result, what started out as a determined young man, some basic landscape maintenance equipment and a dream has developed into the company that exists today.</p> <p>In 1985, Todd Williams began providing landscape maintenance services to commercial clients and growth came quickly. After the first year, well over one hundred clients were being served, setting the stage for rapid annual growth. In 1998, the company began its first venture into public works maintenance with the completion of Colorado’s first toll road – E470. The strategy developed as a result of the toll way’s need for adequate maintenance services at the conclusion of the construction in an unincorporated part of the Denver area. Then in 2008, the company became involved in the privatization of the public works services for the City of Centennial, CO which is the largest transition from public sector to private enterprise in the United States to date. Since then, the company has continued to grow its landscape maintenance and public infrastructure maintenance opportunities. In May of 2009, the company re-branded itself as Terracare Associates.</p> <p>The last 25 years have seen significant growth and change at Terracare Associates. In 2010, the company bolstered its position as a leader in the industry by re-organizing its operations business and improving its focus on customer service and business development, a move that proved successful as the industry struggled in a post 9-11 environment. Since then, the company has implemented a safety training program, expanded the plant health maintenance team, grew its management team to include IT, human resources, sales, and marketing professionals and established a distinct company culture. Today the company has grown to over 400 employees.</p> <h3>Key Points about Terracare Associates</h3> <p>Our goal of leading the outdoor industry in developing sustainable environments, is achieved through creating accountability at every level based on the principles of leadership, integrity, value and environment that drive our organization.
