    <h3 class="lede">Terracare Associates has been involved in and spearheaded many community volunteer projects over the years.</h3>

    <p>Each year, TCA hosts a company-wide service day in conjunction with PLANET Day of Service and Earth Day. Our company community goal is focused on green education, beatification projects and a variety of events that support local companies, counties and municipalities that we serve.  Volunteer projects include a wide range of projects  including, annual landscape maintenance of the Columbine Memorial in Colorado and Butlerville Days in Utah. In California Friends of Marsh Creek assist with creek habitat restoration projects across the East Bay region.  Most recently, team members have volunteered time, expertise and equipment to design, build and maintain edible teaching gardens at local schools. TCA has installed five middle school gardens in the San Francisco Bay Area to educate both children and teachers about the importance of plants as nutritious food and the green industry.</p>
