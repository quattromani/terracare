    <p>Most recently, team members volunteered time, expertise and equipment to design, build and maintain edible teaching gardens at local schools. This includes five middle school gardens in the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition to the gardens, children and teachers are shown the value and importance of plants as a nutritional food supply for family and the future of our Earth.</p>
