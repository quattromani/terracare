<p class="lede">It is through our volunteering that we continue to participate in projects that impact the health and welfare of our local community.</p>

<p>In 2010, Terracare Associates was recognized by the Columbine Memorial Foundation for our volunteer work to provide maintenance service and expertise for the Columbine Memorial. We view our participation in this project honorably and understand the important role we play in contributing to the memory that this project represents. Annually we also participate in the Professional Landcare Networkâ€™s National Day of Service where volunteers work on landscape projects in their local communities. Other volunteer organizations that we regularly participate include; Friends of Marsh Creek, Dry Creek Conservancy, Lincoln Open Space Committee, Baby Haven House, and Rotary International.</p>
