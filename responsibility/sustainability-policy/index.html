Environmental sustainability is at the core of who we are. As our reputation and clientele continue to grow and diversify, the standard of excellence we strive to meet every day keeps us at the forefront of our industry.</h3>

    <h3>Why Sustainable Landscapes?</h3>

    <p>Sustainable landscape practices enhance any outdoor environment and have numerous benefits. Implementing some of these basic practices can contribute to cleaner water and air, cooler temperatures, and let nature renew itself.</p>

    <p>As an example:</p>
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>Retaining organic matter in a landscape increases soil enrichment and lowers contamination compaction and erosion.</li>
      <li>Reducing synthetic chemical use by integrating organic products contributes to a more balanced ecosystem.</li>
      <li>Use of permeability surfaces, helps keep water on site rather than allowing it to flow off site thus contributing to the overtaxed public infrastructure of local municipalities.</li>
      <li>Use of recycled materials reduces the need for hauling debris to local landfill areas.</li>
      <li>Other benefits include resource conservation and regeneration and in some cases resource sharing, natural habitat conservation and biodiversity which helps retain wildlife, and storm water mitigation reducing polluting practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Overall sustainable landscape practices can lead to lower water and energy costs and promote better living conditions for all of us.</p>


    <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
    <h4>At Home</h4>
    <h5>Give an Inch, Save a Yard</h5>
    <p>Grasscycling is a simple method for recycling your yard waste. If you mow your lawn so that grass is never more than 2 to 3 inches tall, leave the grass clippings where they fall and allow them to decompose. The clippings return nutrients to your yard, and you do not have to spend time and money bagging or hauling them away. One study showed that, by not bagging clippings, mowing took about 38 percent less time.</p>

    <h4>Create Some Space and Compost Your Waste</h4>

    <p>Many lawn and landscaping products can be reused or recycled to prevent waste. Composting is one recycling method that turns organic yard waste into a natural soil additive rich in nutrients. Finished compost can improve soil texture, increase the soil’s ability to absorb air and water, suppress weed growth, and decrease erosion. In addition, making and using your own compost can save you money and reduce pollution by reducing the need for you to buy and use commercial soil additives.</p>

    <h3>At Work</h3>
    <h4>Manage Office Equipment Energy Use Better</h4>

    <p>Office equipment and electronics use energy even when idle or on stand-by. To save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at work, always activate the power management features on your computer and monitor, unplug laptop power cords when not in use and turn off equipment and lights at the end of the day.</p>

    <h3>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h3>

    <p>Recycle office paper, newspapers, beverage containers, electronic equipment and batteries. Reducing, reusing, and recycling in your office helps conserve energy, and reduces pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from resource extraction, manufacturing, and disposal.</p>

    <h3>In Your Community</h3>
    <p>Schools, businesses, local governments and other parts of a community can reduce and better manage their waste by working together. Adopt an Environmental Stewardship Action Plan. The Environmental Stewardship Action Plan should strive to preserve environmental resources and improve resources which have been degraded. Ideally the community and economic development should work in harmony with the environmental resources of the community.</p>

    <h3>How We Can Help You</h3>

    <p>We offer a complete Sustainable Management Solution because conventional landscape practices are often harmful in the short term and, in the long run, damage the healthy ecosystems that support all life.</p>

    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>
        Sustainable Management Plan - Invite clients to a discussion of sustainable practices and how they may be used on their properties to save landscape budget dollars.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recycle Green Waste – Compost your green waste and re-use on your site. Nationally,13 percent of municipal waste is from yard and landscape trimmings. Such waste clogs our landfills and costs cities money.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrated Pest Management – Conventional pesticides applications can contaminate ground and surface water and can be harmful to the environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Water Conservation – Evaluate and recommend changes to your current irrigation system to maximize system efficiency and reduce landscape water use. Installing a “smart controller”, converting spray heads to drip and changing out some sprinkler equipment can save 30% of your water use on average. Landscape irrigation accounts for more than 7 billion gallons of potable water daily nationwide.
      </li>
      <li>
        Native Plant Renovation – Renovate your site by designing and installing a more sustainable landscape with water conscious yet aesthetically beautiful plant materials. Exotic invasive species contribute to $38 billion in damage annually in the United States.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turfgrass Renovation - Remove sections of turf not being regularly utilized and replant with a water conserving native plant design.
      </li>
      <li>
        Environmental Restoration – Renovate native areas by returning them to their natural habitat. Soils compacted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Edible Landscapes – Convert turfgrass or shrub bed areas to a useable, interactive edible landscape to engage the local inhabitants and provide a focal point for sustainable discussion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Water Harvesting – Design and install a water harvesting solution to capture, channel and re-use water that can be collected on site. These solutions include collection of rain water, HVAC condensate, cooling tower discharge with cisterns, storage tanks, rain gardens and bio-swales.
      </li>
      <li>
        Install permeable paving materials to reduce stormwater runoff and all rain water to infiltrate into the ground and replenish ground water rather than running into the stormwater run-off system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create energy saving landscapes that place the proper variety of trees for shade and create wind breaks.
      </li>
    </ul>
