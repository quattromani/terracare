    <h3 class="lede"><strong>Good Stewards of our Communities</strong> – We strive to be good corporate citizens every day and on every job. </h3>

    <p>We define our commitment to sustainability as a passion for nurturing outdoor environments – not only now – but for future generations.</p>

    <p>As an outdoor maintenance company, it is of upmost importance to operate in a responsible and thoughtful way to create a beautiful, healthy, respectful and safe environment on our jobs and in our community.</p>

    <p>As an example:</p>
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>Retaining organic matter in a landscape increases soil enrichment and lowers contamination compaction and erosion.</li>
      <li>Reducing synthetic chemical use by integrating organic products contributes to a more balanced ecosystem.</li>
      <li>Use of permeability surfaces, helps keep water on site rather than allowing it to flow off site thus contributing to the overtaxed public infrastructure of local municipalities.</li>
      <li>Use of recycled materials reduces the need for hauling debris to local landfill areas.</li>
      <li>Other benefits include resource conservation and regeneration and in some cases resource sharing, natural habitat conservation and biodiversity which helps retain wildlife, and storm water mitigation reducing polluting practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Overall sustainable landscape practices can lead to lower water and energy costs and promote better living conditions for all of us.</p>


    <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
    <h4>At Home</h4>
    <h5>Give an Inch, Save a Yard</h5>
    <p>Grasscycling is a simple method for recycling your yard waste. If you mow your lawn so that grass is never more than 2 to 3 inches tall, leave the grass clippings where they fall and allow them to decompose. The clippings return nutrients to your yard, and you do not have to spend time and money bagging or hauling them away. One study showed that, by not bagging clippings, mowing took about 38 percent less time.</p>
