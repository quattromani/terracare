    <h3 class="lede">“Safety is for our family” is more than just words.</h3>

    <p>It is practiced 24/7, 365 days a year. Our number one responsibility is to keep customers and our team members safe and healthy. Everyday operations brings this focus home. Every new employee actively participates in extensive safety training before working in the field and is rewarded for a true commitment to safe practices. Each week, team members collaborate solely for this purpose – a proactive approach for mitigating unnecessary risk and jobsite hazards.</p>

    <p>Creating a safety culture also involves undertaking an internal commitment at all levels. Giving safety the same importance as providing quality work, finding efficiencies and making a profit is a top priority.  Examples of TCA’s safety practice include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
