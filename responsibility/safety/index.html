    <h3 class="lede">At Terracare Associates our motto “Safety is for my family” is more than just words. It is practiced 24/7, 365 days a year.</h3>

    <p>The number one responsibility of our company is to keep our team members and our clients safe and healthy.  As a core value safety is a major focus in everyday operations. Every new employee must attend extensive safety training before working in the field at TCA.  We offer incentives to those that continue to use excellent safety practices.  Each week, the staff reviews job safety record and proactively mitigates risk through open and honest discussion of improvement.  Management and field staff meet to discuss jobsite hazards, precautions and take a pro-active approach to alleviate any problems way before it presents violations.</p>

    <p>Creating a safety culture also involves undertaking an internal commitment at all levels. Giving safety the same importance as providing quality work, finding efficiencies and making a profit is a top priority.  Examples of TCA’s safety practice include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
