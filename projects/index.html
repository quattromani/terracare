        <h3>City of Centennial, Colorado </h3>
        <p>This is the largest public private partnership (P3) of its kind in the United States.  The City of Centennial, Colorado is one of the few “Contract Cities” and is intended to collaborate with the private sector to share the risks and rewards involved in the construction and maintenance of public infrastructure projects.  Terracare Associates helped the City of Centennial transition from County provided public works services in 2008 and has been providing comprehensive public works services for the City since that time. Centennial’s city council voted to extend its contract and TCA will continue provide public works services for several more years for its 103,000 residents.  The partnership with CH2M Hill and the city has garnered numerous awards, including the 2010 National Council for Public-Private Partnerships Service Award; 2009 American Public Works Association-Colorado Chapter Innovative Customer Service Call Center Award; 2010 APWA Innovative Customer Service Call Center Award; and 2011 APWA-Colorado Maintenance-Operation for Energy Award. City services include roadway repairs, snow removal, street sweeping, roadway maintenance and sign maintenance.</p>

        <h3>City of Lone Tree, Colorado</h3>
        <p>Faced with the challenge of keeping the City budget in check, the city supervisors chose to outsource their public works services in order to save tax payer money and keep a high level of service. Terracare Associates’ partnership with the City began in 2002, with Terracare Associates providing city wide snow removal services for the 90 miles of city streets and roadways. Within five years, Terracare Associates’ role gradually expanded to full-service operations as the City’s public works department.</p>

        <h3>Northwest Parkway</h3>
        <p>The Northwest Parkway is an 8-mile (13 km) toll road that along with C-470 and E-470 forms a partial beltway of approximately 85 miles (137 km) around the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area. Since 2003, Terracare Associates has partnered with the Northwest Parkway and Brisa Auto-estradas de Portugal to provide comprehensive roadway maintenance and snow removal along the Parkway. Courtesy Patrol services are provided to assist in the event of vehicle mechanical difficulties, flat tires, accident assistance and traffic control.</p>
