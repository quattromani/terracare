<p class="lede">Landscape irrigation accounts for more than 7 billion gallons of potable water daily nationwide. Contrasted against today’s growing population, our sources of water remain the same as they did hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>Current headlines about water are a constant reminder of everyone’s responsibility to use this resource wisely.  Additionally a poorly designed or maintained landscape irrigation system can dramatically increase water costs and diminish the health and beauty of your landscape. Whether your goal is to manage your properties, control budgets for water use, or increase occupancy, a properly maintained and efficient landscape irrigation system can lower your overall cost of operation, reduce potential liability and enhance the appeal of each of your locations.</p>

<h3>How We Can Help You</h3>

<p>Using the latest water management technology, Terracare Associates offers a complete Water Management Solution to maximize your landscape irrigation system operation and reduce water use. Our approach incorporates the latest Sustainable Best Practices because conventional landscape practices are often harmful in the short term and, in the long run, damage the healthy ecosystems that support all life.</p>

<h3>Water Management Planning</h3>

<p>We can help you create a water management plan to provide a strategy for becoming more sustainable on a project and how being environmentally responsible can save landscape budget dollars. See how Terracare Associates saved one client $16,200 in water use and earned a Denver Water rebate of $14,881 Bowles Crossing Case Study.</p>

<p>A five year study of homes in Las Vegas, Nevada by Kent A. Sovocool of the Southern Nevada Water Authority found a 33 percent reduction in average monthly water use and a 39 percent reduction in average summer monthly water use resulting from conversion of water thristy plants and turf to a landscape using more native and drought tolerant plant specifies (Sovocool and Rosales, 2001). In addition, the study found that conversion to a more sustainable landscape reduced annual maintenance costs by one third on top of the water savings.</p>

<h3>Irrigation System Evaluation</h3>

<p>Our trained irrigation technicians can evaluate and recommend changes to your current irrigation system to maximize system efficiency and reduce landscape water use. Installing a “smart controller”, converting sprayheads to drip and changing out some sprinkler equipment can save 30% of your water use on average.</p>

<h3>Irrigation System Water Audit</h3>

<h3>Permeable Hardscape</h3>

<h3>Alternative Water Resource Planning</h3>

<p>Our irrigation technicians can evaluate current landscape water resources and develop plan to switch irrigation water source to an alternative resource including water harvested from rainwater, HVAC condensate, cooling tower discharge, and Greywater. These solutions include collection of these resources into cisterns, storage tanks, rain gardens and bio-swales.</p>

<h3>Native Plant Renovation</h3>

<p>We assist many of our clients in renovating their sites by designing and installing a more sustainable landscape with water conscious yet aesthetically beautiful plant materials.</p>
